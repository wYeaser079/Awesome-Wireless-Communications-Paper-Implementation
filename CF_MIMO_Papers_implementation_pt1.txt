  What You'll Master After All 20 Papers

  After completing this progression, you will have:

  - Theory: Complete mathematical foundation (channel estimation, SE derivation,
   power control, pilot assignment, 4 cooperation levels, DCC clustering)
  - Beamforming: The full precoding ladder — CB → Modified CB → ECB → PZF → ZF →
   MMSE → Optimal (SOCP), plus hybrid beamforming for mmWave
  - DL paradigms: All 4 major approaches — supervised DNNs, unsupervised
  learning, deep reinforcement learning (DDPG/D4PG), deep unfolding (WMMSE
  unrolling), and GNNs
  - Practical aspects: Energy efficiency, fronthaul constraints, user-centric
  clustering, scalability, RF chain management

  This positions you to identify open research gaps — particularly in deep
  unfolding for distributed CF-MIMO, multi-objective GNN optimization,
  transformer-based architectures, and DL under hardware impairments — and
  pursue novel contributions.
